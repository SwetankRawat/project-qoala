terraform --->

1. here I have made three different terraform files for three tasks.
2. Although there can be diff approach if it can be done as a project.
3. There would be var.tf and separately components.tf for provisiong and managing infra.
4. after running terraform init, terraform plan and terraform apply we can acheive our desired infra.
